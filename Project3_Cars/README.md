# Car Gallery App
Developed an android applications as part of mobile development course at University of Illinois at Chicago

Coded an Android app that displays information about cars. The app’s main activity displays a grid whose cells contain a thumbnail picture of a car above the name of the car’s manufacturer. Each grid cell supports two kinds of functionality, depending on whether an app viewer performs a short vs. a long click on the cell. A short click brings up a new activity that shows the entire picture of the selected car on the entire device display. The user can return to the grid view by selecting the “back” soft button on the phone. If, instead, a user clicks anywhere on the displayed picture, a browser activity shows the web site of the car’s manufacturer. 

A long click on a grid cell brings up a “context menu” showing the following three options for the car under consideration: 

</br>(1) View the entire picture (similar to a short click)
</br>(2) Show the official web page of the car manufacturer in a new activity
</br>(3) bring up a list view containing the names and addresses of at
least three car dealers for the selected manufacturer in greater Chicago area.
